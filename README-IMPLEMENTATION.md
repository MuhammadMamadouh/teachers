# 🧑‍🏫 Teachers SaaS Application - Authentication & Approval System

## 📋 Summary

I have successfully implemented a Laravel-based SaaS web application for independent teachers with a complete authentication and teacher approval system.

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 🔐 Authentication System
- **Laravel Breeze** with **Inertia.js + React** for authentication
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** support
- Complete registration, login, logout, and password reset functionality

### 👤 Extended User Model
The `users` table now includes the following fields:
- `name` (string)
- `email` (unique)
- `password` (hashed)
- `phone` (string)
- `subject` (string) → Example: "Math - Grade 9"
- `city` (string)
- `notes` (nullable text)
- `is_approved` (boolean) → default: false
- `is_admin` (boolean) → default: false
- `approved_at` (timestamp, nullable)

### 📝 Registration Flow
- Enhanced registration form with all required teacher fields:
  - Name, Email, Password
  - Phone, Subject (with placeholder examples), City
- After registration, users are **not approved** by default
- Users are redirected to `/pending-approval` page

### 🔒 Authentication Flow
- **After login**:
  - If `is_approved == false`: redirect to `/pending-approval`
  - If `is_approved == true`: redirect to `/dashboard`
  - Admins can always access the system

### 📄 Pending Approval Page
- Clean, professional design with yellow warning icon
- Clear message about pending approval status
- Logout functionality for unapproved users
- Blocks access to the main application until approved

### 🧑‍💼 Admin System

**Admin Panel:**
- Accessible only by users with `is_admin = true`
- Lists all unapproved users with their details:
  - Name, Email, Phone, City, Subject, Registration date
- **Approve** button: Sets `is_approved = true` and `approved_at = now()`
- **Reject** button: Deletes the user account with confirmation

**Admin Dashboard:**
- System overview with key metrics:
  - Total teachers, approved users, pending approvals
  - Total students across all teachers
  - System utilization (student slots used vs. available)
- Subscription plan statistics:
  - Plan details with subscriber counts and limits
  - Plan pricing and features display
- Recent teacher registrations with approval status
- **No student management access for admins**
- **Reject** button: Deletes the user (with confirmation dialog)
- Clean, responsive design with success messages

### � Plan Upgrade System

**Teacher Plan Management:**
- Three subscription plans: Basic (10 students), Standard (25 students), Pro (100 students)
- Teachers can view current plan and available upgrades
- **Upgrade Plan** page with plan comparison and features
- One-click plan upgrade with confirmation
- Instant activation of new student limits
- **Plan navigation** in main menu for easy access

**Plan Features:**
- Visual plan comparison with pricing and limits
- Current usage display (X of Y students used)
- Upgrade benefits clearly outlined
- Manual approval system (no online payments)
- Automatic limit enforcement based on plan

### �🔒 Enhanced Middleware Protection
- **`EnsureUserIsApproved`**: Blocks unapproved users from accessing protected routes
- **`EnsureUserIsAdmin`**: Restricts admin panel to admin users only
- **`EnsureUserIsNotAdmin`**: Prevents admins from accessing student management
- Applied appropriately to protect teacher vs admin functionality

### 🎨 User Interface
- **Modern, clean design** using Tailwind CSS
- **Responsive layout** for mobile and desktop
- **Professional icons** and consistent styling
- **Success/error messages** for user feedback

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Database
- **SQLite** database for easy setup and development
- **Fresh migrations** with all required fields
- **Admin user seeder** (email: admin@teachers.com, password: password123)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Admin Access
- **Email**: admin@teachers.com
- **Password**: password123
- Access the admin panel via "User Approvals" in the navigation

### 2. Teacher Registration
1. Visit the registration page
2. Fill in all required fields (name, email, password, phone, subject, city)
3. After registration, you'll see the pending approval page
4. Admin must approve your account before access is granted

### 3. Development Server
The application is running at: **http://127.0.0.1:8000**

## 🔄 Approval Workflow

1. **Teacher registers** → Account created with `is_approved = false`
2. **Teacher logs in** → Redirected to pending approval page
3. **Admin reviews** → Views pending users in admin panel
4. **Admin approves** → Sets `is_approved = true` and `approved_at = now()`
5. **Teacher gains access** → Can now access dashboard and full application
