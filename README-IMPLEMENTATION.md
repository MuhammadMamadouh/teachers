# 🧑‍🏫 Teachers SaaS Application - Authentication & Approval System

## 📋 Summary

I have successfully implemented a Laravel-based SaaS web application for independent teachers with a complete authentication and teacher approval system.

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 🔐 Authentication System
- **Laravel Breeze** with **Inertia.js + React** for authentication
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** support
- Complete registration, login, logout, and password reset functionality

### 👤 Extended User Model
The `users` table now includes the following fields:
- `name` (string)
- `email` (unique)
- `password` (hashed)
- `phone` (string)
- `subject` (string) → Example: "Math - Grade 9"
- `city` (string)
- `notes` (nullable text)
- `is_approved` (boolean) → default: false
- `is_admin` (boolean) → default: false
- `approved_at` (timestamp, nullable)

### 📝 Registration Flow
- Enhanced registration form with all required teacher fields:
  - Name, Email, Password
  - Phone, Subject (with placeholder examples), City
- After registration, users are **not approved** by default
- Users are redirected to `/pending-approval` page

### 🔒 Authentication Flow
- **After login**:
  - If `is_approved == false`: redirect to `/pending-approval`
  - If `is_approved == true`: redirect to `/dashboard`
  - Admins can always access the system

### 📄 Pending Approval Page
- Clean, professional design with yellow warning icon
- Clear message about pending approval status
- Logout functionality for unapproved users
- Blocks access to the main application until approved

### 🧑‍💼 Admin Panel
- Accessible only by users with `is_admin = true`
- Lists all unapproved users with their details:
  - Name, Email, Phone, City, Subject, Registration date
- **Approve** button: Sets `is_approved = true` and `approved_at = now()`
- **Reject** button: Deletes the user (with confirmation dialog)
- Clean, responsive design with success messages

### 🔒 Middleware Protection
- **`EnsureUserIsApproved`**: Blocks unapproved users from accessing protected routes
- **`EnsureUserIsAdmin`**: Restricts admin panel to admin users only
- Applied to dashboard, profile, and all protected routes

### 🎨 User Interface
- **Modern, clean design** using Tailwind CSS
- **Responsive layout** for mobile and desktop
- **Professional icons** and consistent styling
- **Success/error messages** for user feedback

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Database
- **SQLite** database for easy setup and development
- **Fresh migrations** with all required fields
- **Admin user seeder** (email: admin@teachers.com, password: password123)

### Routes Structure
```php
// Public routes
GET  /                          → Welcome page
GET  /register                  → Registration form
POST /register                  → Process registration
GET  /login                     → Login form
POST /login                     → Process login

// Authenticated routes (unapproved users)
GET  /pending-approval          → Pending approval page

// Authenticated + Approved routes
GET  /dashboard                 → Main dashboard
GET  /profile                   → Profile management

// Admin routes
GET  /admin/users               → User approval panel
POST /admin/users/{user}/approve → Approve user
DELETE /admin/users/{user}/reject → Reject user
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Admin Access
- **Email**: admin@teachers.com
- **Password**: password123
- Access the admin panel via "User Approvals" in the navigation

### 2. Teacher Registration
1. Visit the registration page
2. Fill in all required fields (name, email, password, phone, subject, city)
3. After registration, you'll see the pending approval page
4. Admin must approve your account before access is granted

### 3. Development Server
The application is running at: **http://127.0.0.1:8000**

## 🔄 Approval Workflow

1. **Teacher registers** → Account created with `is_approved = false`
2. **Teacher logs in** → Redirected to pending approval page
3. **Admin reviews** → Views pending users in admin panel
4. **Admin approves** → Sets `is_approved = true` and `approved_at = now()`
5. **Teacher gains access** → Can now access dashboard and full application

## 🌟 Key Features

✅ **Complete authentication system** with Breeze + Inertia + React  
✅ **Teacher registration** with required fields  
✅ **Admin approval workflow** with clean interface  
✅ **Pending approval** page for unapproved users  
✅ **Middleware protection** for all routes  
✅ **Responsive design** with Tailwind CSS  
✅ **SQLite database** for easy development  
✅ **Pre-seeded admin user** for immediate testing  

The system is now ready for the next phase of development (student groups, attendance tracking, and payment management)!
