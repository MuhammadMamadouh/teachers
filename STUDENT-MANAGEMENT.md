## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Student Creation with Limit Validation
```php
// Controller validation before creating
if (!$user->canAddStudents()) {
    throw ValidationException::withMessages([
        'subscription' => 'You have reached your subscription limit for students.',
    ]);
}

// User model method
public function canAddStudents(int $count = 1): bool
{
    $limits = $this->getSubscriptionLimits();
    $currentStudentCount = $this->students()->count();
    return ($currentStudentCount + $count) <= $limits['max_students'];
}
```

### Student Management Routes
```php
Route::resource('students', StudentController::class);
// Generates:
// GET /students - List students
// GET /students/create - Show create form
// POST /students - Store new student
// GET /students/{student} - Show student details
// GET /students/{student}/edit - Show edit form
// PUT /students/{student} - Update student
// DELETE /students/{student} - Delete student
```

### Real-time Subscription Tracking
```javascript
// Dashboard display
<p className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">
    {currentStudentCount} of {subscriptionLimits.max_students}
</p>

// Subscription banner in student list
<p className="text-sm font-medium text-blue-800">
    Using {currentStudentCount} of {subscriptionLimits.max_students} students
    {!canAddStudents && (
        <span className="ml-2 font-normal text-blue-600">
            (Subscription limit reached)
        </span>
    )}
