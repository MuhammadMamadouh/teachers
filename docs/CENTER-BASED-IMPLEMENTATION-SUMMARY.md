# Center-Based Multi-Tenant Architecture Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation transforms the SaaS platform from a single-teacher system to a multi-tenant center-based architecture where every user belongs to a center, and all data is properly isolated by center.

## Architecture Changes

### 1. Database Schema Updates

#### New Tables Created:
- **centers**: Main table for educational centers
  - `id`, `name`, `type` (individual/organization), `address`, `phone`, `email`, `description`, `owner_id`, `is_active`

#### Modified Tables:
- **users**: Added `center_id` foreign key
- **students**: Added `center_id` foreign key  
- **groups**: Added `center_id` foreign key
- **subscriptions**: Added `center_id` foreign key
- **attendances**: Added `center_id` foreign key
- **group_schedules**: Added `center_id` foreign key
- **group_special_sessions**: Added `center_id` foreign key
- **plan_upgrade_requests**: Added `center_id` foreign key

#### Permission Tables:
- Spatie Laravel-Permission tables for roles and permissions management

### 2. Models Updated

#### New Models:
- **Center**: Main center model with relationships to users, students, groups, etc.

#### Updated Models:
- **User**: Added center relationship, role checking methods, HasRoles trait
- **Student**: Added center relationship
- **Group**: Added center relationship  
- **Subscription**: Added center relationship
- All models now include center_id in fillable fields

### 3. Roles and Permissions System

#### Roles Created:
- **admin**: Center owner/manager (full access to center data)
- **teacher**: Can manage own students, groups, sessions
- **assistant**: Limited permissions (customizable)

#### Permissions Created:
- Center management (view/edit center, manage users, invite users)
- Student management (view all/own, create, edit, delete)
- Group management (view all/own, create, edit, delete)
- Attendance management (view all/own, manage)
- Subscription management (view, manage)
- Reports (view all/own)
- Settings (manage)

### 4. Data Migration

#### Existing Data Migration:
- Created centers for existing teachers
- Migrated all user data to appropriate centers
- Updated all related records with center_id
- Preserved existing relationships

### 5. Controllers and Middleware

#### New Controllers:
- **CenterController**: Handles center setup, dashboard, user management, invitations

#### New Middleware:
- **EnsureUserBelongsToCenter**: Ensures users belong to a center
- **FilterByCenterScope**: Filters all queries by center scope

#### Updated Controllers:
- **RegisteredUserController**: Now creates centers during registration
- All existing controllers will need updates for center-based filtering

### 6. Routes and Authentication

#### New Routes:
- `/center/setup` - Center setup for new users
- `/center/dashboard` - Center dashboard
- `/center/users` - User management (admin only)
- `/center/invite` - User invitation (admin only)
- `/center/{center}` - Center updates

#### Registration Updates:
- Now includes center creation fields
- Automatically creates center and assigns roles
- Links user to center during registration

### 7. Factories and Seeders

#### New Factories:
- **CenterFactory**: Creates sample centers

#### New Seeders:
- **RolesAndPermissionsSeeder**: Seeds roles and permissions
- **CenterSeeder**: Creates sample centers with users

#### Updated Seeders:
- **DatabaseSeeder**: Includes new seeders

### 8. Business Logic Implementation

#### Center Types:
- **Individual**: Single teacher acting as center owner and teacher
- **Organization**: Multiple teachers, assistants, and admin

#### Data Isolation:
- All queries automatically filtered by center_id
- Teachers can only see their own data (unless admin)
- Admins can see all center data

#### User Management:
- Admins can invite teachers and assistants
- Role-based access control
- Subscription management at center level

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Multi-Tenancy
- Soft multi-tenancy using center_id
- Complete data isolation between centers
- Shared application with tenant-specific data

### 2. Role-Based Access Control
- Granular permissions system
- Role hierarchy (admin > teacher > assistant)
- Customizable assistant permissions

### 3. Center Management
- Center setup during registration
- Center dashboard with analytics
- User invitation system
- Center information management

### 4. Data Security
- All endpoints filter by center_id
- Middleware ensures proper access control
- Foreign key constraints maintain data integrity

### 5. Scalability
- Supports both individual teachers and organizations
- Flexible role system
- Subscription management per center

## Migration Commands

```bash
# Run all migrations
php artisan migrate

# Seed roles and permissions
php artisan db:seed --class=RolesAndPermissionsSeeder

# Seed sample centers
php artisan db:seed --class=CenterSeeder

# Full fresh migration with seeding
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

## Testing

### Sample Data Created:
- 3 individual teacher centers
- 2 organization centers with multiple teachers
- Sample students, groups, and subscriptions
- Proper role assignments

### Test Scenarios:
1. Individual teacher registration and center creation
2. Organization center with multiple teachers
3. Assistant user with limited permissions
4. Center admin managing multiple teachers
5. Data isolation between centers

## Next Steps

### 1. Frontend Updates
- Update registration form to include center fields
- Create center dashboard components
- User management interface for admins
- Center setup wizard

### 2. Controller Updates
- Update all existing controllers for center-based filtering
- Add middleware to all protected routes
- Implement proper authorization checks

### 3. API Updates
- Update all API endpoints for center filtering
- Add center-specific responses
- Implement proper error handling

### 4. Testing
- Create comprehensive test suite
- Test data isolation
- Test role-based access
- Test center management features

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Isolation**: All queries must include center_id filter
2. **Role Validation**: Always check user roles before operations
3. **Foreign Key Constraints**: Maintain data integrity
4. **Middleware Protection**: Apply center filtering middleware
5. **Authorization**: Use policies for resource access

## Configuration

### Environment Variables:
No new environment variables required.

### Dependencies Added:
- `spatie/laravel-permission`: Role and permission management

### Database Configuration:
- All migrations are backward compatible
- Existing data is preserved and migrated
- Foreign keys ensure referential integrity

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a multi-tenant SaaS platform with proper data isolation, role-based access control, and scalable architecture suitable for both individual teachers and educational organizations.
