### 4. User Experience Features

**Interactive Buttons**:

## Security Features

1. **Authorization**: Only center owners can access
2. **Validation**: Server-side validation for all fields
3. **Unique Email**: Prevents duplicate teacher accounts
4. **Password Security**: Minimum 8 characters, confirmation required
5. **Subscription Limits**: Enforced at controller level
6. **Database Transactions**: Ensures data consistency

## Usage Flow

1. **Center Owner Access**: Navigate to `/center/owner/teachers`
